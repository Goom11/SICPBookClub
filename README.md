# SICP Book Club

### Who are We?

A group of people looking to expand our knowledge of computer programs by reading, discussing, and going through the problems in the book, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. 

### Logistics

Aman Agarwal, Chris Orcutt, and friends will help with some of the logistical concerns with the book club along with directly participating.

## Exercises

We will be doing the exercises in [Racket](http://racket-lang.org/), a scheme. This is not a heavily researched decision so please suggest alternatives if you believe there are better alternatives. Racket has its own IDE, Dr. Racket.

## Future

I'd like to imagine that this club goes on to read other computer science/software development related books but I'd be okay if that remains but a fragment of my reverie.
