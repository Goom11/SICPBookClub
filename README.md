## Syllabus

### Course Meeting Times

Meeting times will vary. Check [the facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/466276546890313/466278320223469/) for exact specifics. We will likely meet once a week.

## Calendar

Week # | Sections | Exercises | Meeting
-             | -              | -                | -
1            | 1.1.6       | 1.5           | [Party at Orcutt's](https://www.facebook.com/groups/466276546890313/permalink/466278320223469/) 

## Exercises

We will be doing the exercises in [Racket](http://racket-lang.org/), a scheme. This is not a heavily researched decision so please suggest alternatives if you believe there are better alternatives. Racket has its own IDE, Dr. Racket.

## Future

I'd like to imagine that this club goes on to read other computer science/software development related books but I'd be okay if that remains but a fragment of my reverie.
